"""Public sqlite3 connection factory for kb-mcp.

This module hosts the helpers used by every sqlite3 connection the
project opens: the main store, the vec0 side connection, and the
background embedding worker. They were previously private functions
on :mod:`kb_mcp_lite.store.sqlite`; promoting them here lets the
worker and the embedding mixin open their own connections without
reaching into another module's underscore-prefixed API.

Why one factory
---------------
All connections to the same database MUST go through
:func:`make_sqlite_connection` so they share one SQLite library
(pysqlite3 or stdlib). Mixing the two against one WAL-mode database
corrupts the shared WAL index — observed as "database disk image is
malformed" when a stdlib connection closes while a pysqlite3
connection is still live.

This module is part of the ``store`` subpackage's internal API: it
is not re-exported from :mod:`kb_mcp_lite.store` because end users
should not open ad-hoc sqlite3 connections. Subpackage modules
(``worker.py``, ``embedding.py``, ``sqlite.py``) are the only
expected callers.
