"""Async embedding queue for kb-mcp.

This module implements the queue half of the v0.8.0 async-embedding feature
(特性 #1 异步化嵌入). It owns the SQL rows in the ``embedding_queue`` table
created by migration 0007 and exposes a small, race-free API used by:

* :class:`SqliteStore` — to enqueue when documents are added/updated.
* :class:`EmbeddingWorker` (in ``kb_mcp_lite.worker``) — to claim work,
  record outcomes, and inspect the queue.
* The CLI / MCP embedding admin commands — to read status and retry.

State machine
-------------
::

    pending  ──(claim)──>  in_progress
    in_progress  ──(ok)──>  done
    in_progress  ──(transient)──>  pending  (attempts < max_attempts)
    in_progress  ──(permanent)──>  failed  (attempts >= max_attempts)

``done`` and ``failed`` are terminal: a row in either state is invisible
to :meth:`claim_next` until a human (or :meth:`retry`) flips it back to
``pending``. The transitions are enforced both here and by the ``CHECK``
constraint in the SQL schema.

Backoff schedule
----------------
The exponential backoff lives in :data:`BACKOFF_SECONDS`. The worker
reads :attr:`EmbeddingQueueEntry.attempts` and computes the earliest
eligible retry time as ``last_attempt_at + backoff[attempts - 1]`` (or
``now`` if attempts == 0). Because we store ``last_attempt_at`` and
``attempts`` together, the schedule survives a process restart — the
queue is the source of truth for retry timing, not in-memory timers.
