"""Store Protocol — the interface every storage backend must implement.

This module defines the **contract** only. The concrete SQLite
implementation lives in :mod:`kb_mcp_lite.store.sqlite`. Tests against this
Protocol are in ``tests/test_store_contract.py``.

Why a Protocol
--------------

The Store is the single integration point between kb-mcp and its data
layer. By depending on a Protocol (PEP 544 structural subtyping) instead
of a concrete class:

- the CLI, MCP server, and Markdown I/O modules can be developed and
  unit-tested against a ``StubStore`` (in-memory dict) without touching
  SQLite;
- alternative backends (Postgres, in-memory, HTTP) can be added later by
  implementing the same Protocol;
- the E2E tests in Wave 2 swap implementations to exercise both paths.

Concurrency
------------

The Protocol does **not** promise thread safety. v0.1 uses SQLite in WAL
mode with one connection per process; multi-process access (e.g. two
``kb`` CLI invocations against the same DB) is supported because SQLite
WAL serialises writers, but a single process must serialise its own
calls. The MCP server and CLI are both single-threaded; this is not a
concern for v0.1.

Soft delete
-----------

``delete()`` sets ``deleted_at`` rather than removing the row. ``get()``,
``list()``, ``search()`` all filter out soft-deleted rows. ``prune()``
hard-deletes soft-deleted rows older than a configurable grace period.
This makes ``kb import`` idempotent and recoverable.

Failure modes
-------------

Every method either:

- returns the documented value (no exception on "not found" for
  ``list`` / ``search``);
- raises one of the exceptions from :mod:`kb_mcp_lite.schema` (``NotFoundError``,
  ``DuplicateError``, ``ValidationError``, ``IntegrityError``).

Callers MUST handle these. Callers MUST NOT catch the generic
``Exception`` to keep error semantics intact.
