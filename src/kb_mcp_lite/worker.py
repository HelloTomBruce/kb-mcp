"""Background embedding worker for kb-mcp.

This module provides :class:`EmbeddingWorker`, a long-running background
thread that drains the :class:`~kb_mcp_lite.store.embedding_queue.EmbeddingQueue`
created by migration 0007.

Design constraints (from the v0.8.0 design doc, §特性 #1 异步化嵌入):

* **Failure is silent.** A failed embedding never blocks the call that
  enqueued the document. Errors land in the queue row's ``last_error``
  column; users see them via ``kb embed status`` / ``kb_embed_status``.
* **Backoff is exponential.** After each transient failure the row is
  re-queued with a delay from :data:`BACKOFF_SECONDS` (1s, 5s, 30s, 5m,
  30m). After ``max_attempts`` failures the row moves to ``failed`` and
  is invisible to the worker until a human runs ``kb embed retry``.
* **Process-local lifecycle.** The worker is owned by a
  :class:`~kb_mcp_lite.store.sqlite.SqliteStore` instance. When the
  store is closed the worker thread is asked to stop; an ``atexit``
  hook stops any worker still alive at interpreter shutdown so we never
  leak threads holding open file descriptors on a fast-exit script.
* **One worker per process.** Multiple stores within one process share
  at most one worker (the first store to need one registers an
  ``atexit`` cleanup that joins every worker it spawned).

    The default :func:`sqlite3.connect` sets ``check_same_thread=True``,
    which means a connection born on the main thread cannot be touched
    from the worker thread. pysqlite3 (the project's preferred backend)
    enforces the check in C and does not expose ``check_same_thread`` as
    a settable Python attribute, so the only way to relax it is at
    construction time. The factory now accepts a ``check_same_thread``
    kwarg; the worker passes ``False``.

    The worker is a single thread, and SQLite's own locking (WAL +
    busy_timeout) keeps concurrent writers safe. WAL mode also lets the
    store's main connection read whatever the worker just wrote
    without any extra ceremony.

    We also re-use the store's connection factory so the worker
    connection comes from the same SQLite library (pysqlite3 vs
    stdlib). Mixing the two on one database corrupts the WAL index —
    see the warning in

    # * WAL keeps the worker's writes visible to the store's main
    #   connection without a manual checkpoint.
    # * ``synchronous = NORMAL`` is the trade-off the project ships
    #   with. ``:memory:`` databases and read-only mounts can refuse
    #   WAL; the worker falls back to the connection's default journal
    #   mode in that case, which is still safe for the single-writer
    #   workload the worker performs.
    # * ``busy_timeout = 5000`` is required for pysqlite3 specifically:
