"""SQLite migration runner.

Migrations are versioned, forward-only SQL files under
``kb_mcp_lite/migrations/``. Each file MUST be named ``NNNN_*.sql`` where
``NNNN`` is a zero-padded integer; the runner applies them in order and
records the version in the ``schema_version`` table.

A migration is run inside a transaction; if it fails, the DB is rolled
back to the previous version. The runner is safe to call on every
``__init__`` — it is a no-op if the schema is already current.
